# Microverse-Js-capstone
> This capstone project is designed to allow you to view movie lists and interact by liking or commenting.

It is built as a part of Microverse Web Developer Course. This is the capstone project of the second module within the scope of the course.

In this project, we created a webapp using a TVmaze API that gives data about TV series and Movies. The TVmaze API allowed us to get a list of items with a unique ID and to also get detailed information about the item. In addition to the TVmaze API, we used an Involvement API created by Microverse to record interactions on the app such as likes and comments. Using the wireframe provided, we built a header, footer, homepage and comments popup page.

* @Ghiftee worked as Student A on this project and implemented everything that has to do with the movies display on the homepage and the like button.
* @tacettinkustu worked as Student B and created everything that involves the comment button and comment page popup.

Each branch on this project was created from the dev branch and they represent a card on the Kanban board. After working on each card/branch(excluding the set-up branch which we worked on together), we reviewed each other's codes and did not begin work on the next card/branch until our pull request was approved.

## Project Description

The JavaScript capstone project is about building your own web application based on an external API. You will select an API that provides data about a topic that you like and then build the webapp around it. The webapp will have 2 interfaces:

* A home page showing a list of items that you can "like."
* A popup window with more data about an item that you can use to comment on it.

## Project Objectives

* Use JavaScript to make websites dynamic and build basic single page apps.
* Use ES6 syntax.
* Use ES6 modules.
* Use callbacks and promises.
* Use webpack.
* Apply JavaScript best practices and language style guides in code.
* Use AAA pattern for unit tests.
* Write units tests for a JavaScript app.
* Follow Gitflow.
* Solve simple git conflicts.
* Send and receive data from an API.
* Use API documentation.
* Understand and use JSON.
* Make JavaScript code synchronous.
* Perform a code review for a team member.
